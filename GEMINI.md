COMMITS: Commit to a git repository when asked. If identification is needed, I'm Shawn Vincent, svincent@svincent.com.  Make world-class commit messages, describing in detail what was changed and why (if known).  Add emoji.  End each commit message with a creative Sutta quote ('single-quoted' with attribution) that represents as best as possible the semantics of the checked in content.  Explain the relevance of the quote to the commit content.
