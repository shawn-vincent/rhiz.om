# UI/UX Recommendations: Being Selection and Editing
**Date**: January 23, 2025  
**Author**: Shawn Vincent (svincent@svincent.com)  
**Status**: Proposal

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive UX review of the being selection and editing system in rhiz.om, identifying current pain points and proposing architectural improvements that align with the project's "everything is a being" philosophy and "simple > elegant > power" design principle. The key requirement is that editing a being should maintain the user's context within the current space rather than navigating away.

## Current State Analysis

### System Overview

The being management system consists of:
- **EntityCard** components for visual representation
- **BeingSelector** for search and selection
- **Config Panel** showing space details and beings
- **Site Menu** for navigation
- **Being Presence** indicators
- **Edit Pages** at `/being/{beingId}/edit`

### Identified Pain Points

1. **Navigation Confusion**
   - After editing a being, the back button navigates to the edited being's page rather than the originating space
   - This breaks the user's mental model of spatial navigation

2. **Unclear Interaction Model**
   - EntityCards appear clickable but have no default action
   - Only the pencil icon is actionable, creating a disconnect between visual affordance and behavior

3. **Permission Visibility**
   - Pencil icons display for all beings regardless of edit permissions
   - Users only discover lack of permissions after navigation
   - Current authorization is simple ownership-based with no role system

4. **Missing Creation Flow**
   - No clear pathway to create new beings within a space
   - No empty state guidance for new users

5. **Information Architecture Redundancy**
   - Three panels (site menu, config, presence) show overlapping information
   - Different interaction patterns across panels create confusion

## Design Philosophy Alignment

### Core Principles (from requirements)
- **Everything is a Being**: Unified entity model
- **Spatial Metaphor**: Navigable, nestable environments
- **Recursive Depth**: Any being can contain other beings
- **Mindful Interaction**: Focus on presence over productivity
- **Simple > Elegant > Power**: Prioritize clarity

### Current Implementation Gaps
- Spatial navigation is partially implemented but inconsistent
- The "click to focus" pattern from requirements isn't fully realized
- Permission model lacks the sophistication needed for collaborative spaces

## Proposed Solutions

### Recommended: Option 1 - Context-Preserving Modal/Panel Editing

Since editing should maintain space context, this approach keeps users in their current space while editing beings.

#### Implementation Details

**1. Interaction Flow**
```
Click EntityCard → Selects/highlights the being
Click Edit button → Opens editor in modal/panel
                  → Space remains visible/accessible
                  → Save/Cancel returns to space view
```

**2. EntityCard Behavior**
```typescript
<EntityCard 
  entity={being}
  onClick={() => setSelectedBeing(being.id)}
  isSelected={selectedBeing === being.id}
  showEditButton={canEdit(being) && isSelected}
  isOnline={presenceMap.get(being.id)}
/>
```

**3. Edit Modes**
- **Desktop**: Side panel slides in from right
- **Tablet**: Modal dialog overlay
- **Mobile**: Bottom sheet slides up

#### Pros
- Maintains space context throughout
- No navigation stack issues
- Fast editing workflow
- Clear mental model: "editing IN the space"

#### Cons
- Requires state management for selection
- Need to handle multiple panels gracefully

### Alternative: Option 2 - Inline Expansion Editing

Edit directly within the card's position:

#### Implementation
- Click EntityCard expands to show edit form
- Other cards dim or move aside
- Save collapses back to card view

#### Pros
- Extremely contextual
- Minimal UI disruption
- Clear what's being edited

#### Cons
- Complex animations
- Limited space for form fields
- Poor for complex beings (bots)

### Alternative: Option 3 - Click-to-Navigate Pattern

The spatial navigation approach (not recommended given the requirement):

#### Implementation
- Click EntityCard navigates to being's space
- Edit happens within that being's context
- Back button returns to previous space

#### Pros
- Aligns with "everything is a space" philosophy
- Clean separation of contexts

#### Cons
- Breaks the requirement to stay in current space
- Confusing navigation stack
- Loses context of where being exists

## Being Creation Recommendations

### 1. Contextual FAB (Recommended)
```typescript
{canCreateInSpace && (
  <FAB
    icon={<Plus />}
    label="Add Being"
    position={{ bottom: 24, right: 24 }}
    onClick={handleCreateBeing}
  />
)}
```

### 2. Empty State CTA
```typescript
{beings.length === 0 && canCreateInSpace && (
  <EmptyState
    icon={<Users />}
    title="No beings in this space yet"
    action={{
      label: "Add your first being",
      onClick: handleCreateBeing
    }}
  />
)}
```

### 3. Command Palette Integration
- `Cmd+K` → "Create being in current space"
- Power user optimization

## Information Architecture Redesign

### Proposed Structure
```
Space View (/being/{spaceId})
├── Header
│   ├── Space Identity (Avatar + Name)
│   ├── Presence Indicators (compact avatar stack)
│   └── Space Menu (•••)
│       ├── Edit This Space (if owner)
│       ├── Space Settings
│       ├── Add Being Here
│       └── Leave Space
├── Main Content
│   ├── Being Grid
│   │   └── EntityCards (click → select)
│   └── FAB (if authorized)
└── Edit Panel/Modal (when being selected)
    ├── Being Edit Form
    ├── Save/Cancel Actions
    └── Delete Option (if owner)
```

### Panel Consolidation
1. **Remove Config Panel** - Merge functionality into space header menu
2. **Simplify Site Menu** - Pure navigation, no being management
3. **Integrate Presence** - Inline with space content, not separate panel

## Permission Model Enhancement

### Visual Permission System
```typescript
interface BeingPermissions {
  canView: boolean;
  canEdit: boolean;
  canDelete: boolean;
  canInvite: boolean;
  isOwner: boolean;
}

// Visual indicators
- Owner badge: Crown icon
- Edit permission: Pencil badge
- View-only: Lock icon
```

### Future Role System (Phase 2)
```typescript
enum SpaceRole {
  OWNER = "owner",
  ADMIN = "admin", 
  MEMBER = "member",
  VIEWER = "viewer"
}
```

## Mobile-First Considerations

### Touch Optimization
- Minimum 48px touch targets
- Swipe gestures for quick actions
- Bottom sheet patterns for forms

### Responsive Behaviors
```typescript
const isMobile = useMediaQuery("(max-width: 768px)");

if (isMobile) {
  // Bottom sheet for editing
  // Full-screen navigation
  // Simplified presence indicators
} else {
  // Side panel for details
  // Popover for quick edits
  // Rich presence information
}
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Selection State & Edit Modal (2-3 days)
- [ ] Implement being selection state in space view
- [ ] Create modal/panel edit component
- [ ] Wire up edit form to work in overlay context

### Phase 2: Context-Aware UI (2-3 days)
- [ ] Update EntityCards to show selection state
- [ ] Add edit button on selected cards
- [ ] Implement responsive edit panel behavior

### Phase 3: Permission Visibility (2-3 days)
- [ ] Add permission checks to UI components
- [ ] Implement visual permission indicators
- [ ] Hide non-actionable UI elements

### Phase 4: Being Creation (3-4 days)
- [ ] Implement FAB component
- [ ] Add empty state designs
- [ ] Create "New Being" form in modal

### Phase 5: Panel Consolidation (3-4 days)
- [ ] Remove redundant Config panel
- [ ] Simplify Site Menu to navigation only
- [ ] Integrate all being management into space view

## Success Metrics

1. **Navigation Coherence**: Back button always returns to previous context
2. **Action Clarity**: Users understand what's clickable and why
3. **Permission Transparency**: Edit capabilities visible before action
4. **Creation Simplicity**: < 3 clicks to create new being
5. **Mobile Parity**: All features accessible on mobile

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Consider using URL state for panel visibility
- Implement proper loading/error boundaries
- Add optimistic updates for better perceived performance

### Performance
- Lazy load edit forms
- Virtualize long being lists
- Implement proper React.memo boundaries

### Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation throughout
- Add proper ARIA labels
- Maintain focus management in modals/panels

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Context-Preserving Editing?

1. **Mental Model Clarity**: Users understand they're editing a being "within" a space, not navigating to it
2. **Workflow Efficiency**: No context switching when managing multiple beings
3. **Spatial Hierarchy**: Reinforces that beings exist within spaces
4. **Undo Confidence**: Easy to cancel without navigation confusion

### EntityCard Interaction Model

```typescript
// Proposed interaction states
interface EntityCardState {
  default: "hover shows preview";
  selected: "shows edit/delete actions";
  editing: "card dimmed, edit panel open";
  loading: "optimistic update animation";
}
```

### Edit Panel Behaviors

**Desktop (> 1024px)**
- Slide-in panel from right (400px wide)
- Space content shifts left or overlays with scrim
- Keyboard shortcuts (Esc to close, Cmd+S to save)

**Tablet (768-1024px)**
- Modal dialog centered
- Background scrim
- Touch-friendly controls

**Mobile (< 768px)**
- Bottom sheet (full height available)
- Swipe down to dismiss
- Sticky save/cancel buttons

## Conclusion

The context-preserving edit approach solves the navigation confusion while maintaining the spatial metaphor of rhiz.om. By keeping users within their current space during edits, we create a more intuitive and efficient workflow. This design scales well from mobile to desktop and provides clear pathways for future enhancements like bulk editing or keyboard-driven workflows.
