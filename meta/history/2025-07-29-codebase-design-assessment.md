# Codebase Design Assessment - July 29, 2025

**Architecture verdict:** DRIFTING  
**Overall assessment:** This is a sophisticated application with solid foundations, but architectural boundaries are beginning to blur and surface complexity is growing.

## Executive Summary

Would I be proud of this application? **Mostly yes**, with important caveats. The core entity-based architecture is elegant and the recent entity operations refactor shows disciplined consolidation. However, the system is drifting toward feature creep and boundary violations that need attention.

**Strengths:**
- Unique Being/Intention data model provides flexible entity system
- Type-safe end-to-end with tRPC, Drizzle, and Zod validation
- Recent entity operations refactor eliminated 200+ lines of duplication
- LiveKit media controls implementation is clean and well-structured
- Solid authentication flow with NextAuth.js 5.0 beta

**Concerns:**
- Growing surface complexity across components and hooks
- Sync system shows signs of architectural drift
- Missing clear API versioning and migration strategy
- Some boundary violations between layers

## Recent Changes Analysis

### 1. Entity Operations Refactor (Commit afd29ae) ✅ EXCELLENT
**Impact:** Eliminated 90% code duplication across 8+ locations

The consolidation into `/src/lib/being-operations.ts` with 4 core functions is exemplary:
- `createBeing()`, `updateBeing()`, `createIntention()`, `updateIntention()`
- Centralizes authorization, database operations, sync notifications
- Transforms complex multi-step operations into one-liners
- Maintains all functionality while improving maintainability

**Before:**
```typescript
// BeingService.upsertBeing() - 90+ lines
// Multiple scattered implementations
// Duplicate authorization logic
```

**After:**
```typescript
async upsertBeing(input: InsertBeing, auth: AuthContext): Promise<Being> {
    const { updateBeing } = await import("~/lib/being-operations");
    return await updateBeing(this.db, input, auth);
}
```

This is exactly the kind of architectural discipline the codebase needs.

### 2. LiveKit Media Controls (Commit d48856f) ✅ GOOD
**Implementation:** Clean hook-based architecture with proper state management

The `useLiveKitMediaControls` hook demonstrates good separation of concerns:
- Pure state management without UI coupling
- Proper event listener cleanup
- Clear error handling with user feedback
- Consistent API across camera/microphone/screenshare

**Strengths:**
- Uses LiveKit's built-in participant state properties
- Proper React patterns with refs to avoid dependency issues
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Clean interface with pending states

### 3. Sync System Fixes (Commits 2446270, 5b14c75) ⚠️ CONCERNING
**Issue:** Repeated infinite loop fixes suggest architectural instability

While the fixes are correct (useRef pattern for unstable function references, bot activation scoping), the pattern of sync-related bugs indicates deeper issues:

```typescript
// Fixed: Unstable refetch function dependencies
const refetchBeingsRef = useRef(refetchBeings);
const refetchIntentionsRef = useRef(refetchIntentions);
```

This is treating symptoms rather than addressing root cause.

## Architectural Assessment

### ✅ Domain Layer (CLEAN)
The entity-based architecture is the system's crown jewel:

```typescript
// Clean domain service pattern
export class BeingService {
    constructor(private db: DrizzleDB) {}
    
    async getBeing(id: string): Promise<Being> {
        // Pure business logic
    }
}
```

- Clear separation between Being and Intention services
- Proper dependency injection with DrizzleDB
- Type-safe with Zod schemas throughout

### ✅ Database Schema (CLEAN)
The PostgreSQL schema with Drizzle is well-designed:

```sql
-- Self-referential beings with location hierarchy
beings.ownerId -> beings.id
beings.locationId -> beings.id

-- Intentions linked to beings for ownership and location
intentions.ownerId -> beings.id
intentions.locationId -> beings.id
```

- JSONB content fields provide flexibility
- Proper indexing on owner/location lookups
- Multi-project schema with `rhiz_om_` prefix

### ⚠️ API Layer (DRIFTING)
tRPC routers maintain type safety but show growing complexity:

```typescript
// Good: Type-safe procedures
export const beingRouter = createTRPCRouter({
    getById: publicProcedure
        .input(z.object({ id: z.string() }))
        .output(selectBeingSchema)
        .query(async ({ input }) => {
            return services.being.getBeing(input.id);
        }),
```

**Issues:**
- No versioning strategy for API changes
- Growing surface area across routers
- Missing rate limiting and caching policies

### ⚠️ React Components (DRIFTING)
Component architecture shows signs of feature creep:

```typescript
// Concerning: Growing prop surfaces
interface MediaControlsState {
    // 15+ properties for single hook
    isCameraEnabled: boolean;
    isCameraPending: boolean;
    toggleCamera: (forceState?: boolean) => Promise<void>;
    // ... 12 more properties
}
```

**Boundary violations:**
- `/src/app/_components/bottom-bar.tsx` - 60+ lines mixing UI and business logic
- Components directly importing domain services
- Growing hook complexity with multiple responsibilities

### ⚠️ Sync System (ENTANGLED)
The real-time sync system shows architectural stress:

**Current implementation:**
```typescript
// useSync hook with unstable dependencies
const { data: beings, refetch: refetchBeings } = api.being.getByLocation.useQuery(...)
const { data: intentions, refetch: refetchIntentions } = api.intention.getAllUtterancesInBeing.useQuery(...)

// Workaround for React Query instability
const refetchBeingsRef = useRef(refetchBeings);
```

**Problems:**
- Mixed concerns: LiveKit + custom events + tRPC queries
- Reactive programming patterns fighting each other
- No clear data flow boundaries
- Repeated infinite loop bugs indicate design instability

## Boundary Violations

### 1. `/src/app/_components/bottom-bar.tsx` (Lines 45-60)
UI component directly managing LiveKit room state:
```typescript
const room = useLiveKitRoom();
const mediaControls = useLiveKitMediaControls(room);
// Should delegate to domain layer
```

### 2. `/src/hooks/use-sync.ts` (Lines 6-9)
Hook directly calling tRPC instead of going through domain services:
```typescript
const { data: beings, refetch: refetchBeings } = api.being.getByLocation.useQuery(...)
// Should use domain services
```

### 3. `/src/app/_components/chat.tsx` (estimated)
Likely mixing UI rendering with intention creation logic based on patterns.

## Surface Diet Recommendations

### Delete/Inline (Reduce Abstractions)

1. **Wrapper Hooks**: Many hooks are thin wrappers around single tRPC calls
2. **One-Call-Site Components**: Several UI components used only once
3. **Optional Boolean Parameters**: Replace with explicit variants

### Rename/Restructure

1. **`being-operations.ts`** → Move to `/src/domain/being-operations.ts` (proper layer)
2. **`use-sync.ts`** → Split into `useBeing.ts` and `useIntentions.ts`
3. **Media controls** → Reduce 15-property interface to 3 focused functions

## Proposed Refactoring Plan

### Commit 1: Sync System Simplification
```typescript
// Replace complex useSync with focused hooks
const beings = useBeingsInLocation(spaceId);
const intentions = useIntentionsInLocation(spaceId);

// Single sync mechanism instead of mixed events
const sync = useLiveKitSync(spaceId);
```

### Commit 2: Component Boundary Cleanup
```typescript
// Move business logic to domain layer
// UI components only handle rendering and user events
<BottomBar 
  onToggleCamera={mediaActions.toggleCamera}
  onToggleMic={mediaActions.toggleMicrophone}
  // UI concerns only
/>
```

### Commit 3: API Versioning
```typescript
// Add explicit API versioning
export const beingRouterV1 = createTRPCRouter({
  // Current endpoints
});

// Future migration path
export const beingRouterV2 = createTRPCRouter({
  // Breaking changes
});
```

### Commit 4: Surface Reduction
- Eliminate one-call-site abstractions
- Combine related hooks into focused services
- Replace boolean optional params with explicit variants

## Performance & Migrations

### Current Performance Posture
- **Good:** No N+1 queries visible in schema
- **Good:** Database indexes on hot paths (location, owner)
- **Concerning:** No caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- **Missing:** Bundle analysis and code splitting

### Migration Strategy
- **Forward-safe:** Database schema uses JSONB for flexibility
- **Reversible:** Need to add DOWN migrations to Drizzle scripts
- **Zero-downtime:** Current pattern supports this but needs documentation

## Final Verdict

This is a **well-designed application with disciplined engineering practices**, but it's at a critical juncture. The recent entity operations refactor shows the team can execute architectural consolidation when needed.

**The system needs:**
1. **Sync architecture review** - Current approach is fighting itself
2. **Component boundary enforcement** - Stop business logic drift into UI layer
3. **Surface diet** - Reduce unnecessary abstractions
4. **API governance** - Add versioning and migration strategy

**Would I be proud?** Yes, with the caveat that this needs 2-3 focused refactoring commits to prevent architectural drift from becoming architectural debt.

The foundations are solid. The entity model is elegant. The type safety is comprehensive. The recent consolidation work shows good architectural instincts. Fix the sync system and enforce layer boundaries, and this becomes an exemplary T3 Stack application.
